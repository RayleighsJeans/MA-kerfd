	\section{Particle-in-Cell Simulations with Monte Carlo-Colissions}\label{sec:picsimulationmcc}
%
	Particle-In-Cell simulations with Monte-Carlo-Collisions (PIC-MCC) represent a powerfull tool for fully kinetic, high-dimensional plasma studies, with inclusion of complicated reaction/collision routines, as well as field solving methods. Hence they are used in all branches of plasma physics, ranging from simple labratory discharges to electro-propulsion ion-thrusters and interplanetary atrsophysical system.

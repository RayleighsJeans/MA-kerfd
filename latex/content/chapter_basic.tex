\chapter{Physical Properties of Low Temperature RF Plasma}

  In this first chapter I will provide the necessary physical background 
  for this work about the numerical simulation of low temperature 
  capacitively coupled radio frequency plasma. Here both the mathematical 
  basics and method for the simulation, as well as the most important aspects
  about the plasma properties will be explained.

  \section{Plasma Physics}

    \subsection{Capacitively Coupled Radio Frequency Plasma}

      The experiment where after the conducted simulations is modelled after revolves around a capacitively coupled radio frequency, low temperature plasma at low pressures of oxygen. \\
      Here, I will refer to a plasma as an globally quasi-neutral gas, consisting of freely moving charges --- e.g.\@ electrons, positiviely and negatively ions --- and neutral gas particles. The ratio between charged and neutral species defines the \emph{degree of ionization}, which in this case is very low. The term of global neutrality emphasizes the purpose for different lenght scales inside the gas itself. Hence, the associated condition of neutrality by equal densities $n\ix{e}\,=\,n\ix{i}$ only is valid for areas larger than the so called \emph{Debye sphere}. Inside this ball with a radius of $\lambda\ix{D}$, the \emph{Debye length}, the afore-mentioned neutrality is not satisfied.\\
      The creation of a plasma is accomplished by 2 parallel metal plates --- the electrodes --- where on at least one an AC signal at radio frequency is applied --- this kind of experimental setup is among the most common, thus being used for basic but also in-depth studies of the afore-mentioned discharges. Here, a rf signal at exactly $\unit[13,56]{MHz}$ with an amplitude between $100$--$\unit[1000]{V}$ will be used --- this corresponds to a wavelength of $\unit[22,11]{m}$ for the excitation. The use of external magnetic fields is not within the scope of this work --- correspondingly, the experiment I will refer to also did not include $\vec{B}$-fields. \\
      That said, a multitude of electric setups are possible, such as coated or grounded electrodes. Therefore, different regimes of operation ensue. For example, differently driven or shaped metal plates heavily influence the charge creation process inside the plasma. In summary, the electrodes, neutral gas and electric layout resemble a dielectric hindered plate capacitor. This simplification can be used to access important physical properties, such as an additional voltage offset on one of the electrodes or charge currents at such. A basic scheme of an asymmetric rf discharge can be seen in~\autoref{fig:circuitselfbias_1}.

				The rf signal is denoted with $U(t)$.}\label{fig:circuitselfbias_1}
			\end{wrapfigure}

      In the case of different electrode sizes, as seen in the scheme, the potential inside the spatially restricted area between wall and discharge can change drastically. This plasma sheath forms also between grounded parts of discharge containment or probes and plasma volume. This additional direct current offset is called \emph{self-bias} (see~\autoref{subsec:selfbias}). A dielectric displacement current between plasma sheath and volume accomodates as a result of the different time scales of particle movement (see~\autoref{subsec:displacementcurrent}). Especially, self-bias and displacement current play a key role in the following investigations, as a capacitive coupling between electrodes and power supply is difficult to model in a numerical kinetic simulation.\\
		In comparison to other low temperature, low pressure discharges  --- an example could be a dielectric hindered dc discharge at high voltages, with an electrode space gap of just a couple millimeters ---, radio frequency plasma are characterized by their unique transport process inside the sheath and heating mechanisms of charged species. A more in-depth discussion can be found in~\autoref{subsec:heating}.\\ 

		\subsection{Sheath Physics and Wall Interaction}\label{subsec:sheathphysics}

			In the discharges bulk, neutral gas particles are exctited by electron collisions and radiating visible light. However, areas around, e.g.\@ floating metal surfaces, probes and grounded walls are darker than the bulk. This is due to the low electron density and kinetic energy in this \emph{plasma sheath}. Though areas with vanishing electron numbers can glow because of high collision efficiencies and/or frequencies.\\
			Electrons, in general, are of a much higher mobility $\mu\ix{e}$ and thermal velocity $v\ix{th,e}$. Hence they impinge onto walls and surfaces more often than other species, leading to a --- in this case we consider an electronegative oxygen discharge, where the following can be assumed true --- negative charge and potential.

			\subsubsection*{Child-Langmuir Law}

				For an asymmetric ccrf discharge, DC \emph{self bias} and displacement current are important parts of the electric system. Hence, the \emph{Child-Langmuir Law} as a function of those properties can be written. The rf component of the excitation is neglected.\\
				A greatly negative charged wall at $x=0$ shall be a barrier for electrons of thermal velocity, e.g.\@ $|\Phi(0)-\Phi(d)|\ll k\ix{B}T\ix{e}/e\,$. The thickness of the sheath shall be considered $d$. In an one-dimensional approach, the electron density $n\ix{e}(x)$ can be written with a \emph{Boltzmann} distribution function $f\ix{B}(\Phi)$ :

				\begin{align}
					n\ix{e}(x)=n\ix{e}(d)\cdot f\ix{B}(\Phi)=%
					n\ix{e}(d)\cdot%
					\exp{\left(\frac{e{\left(\Phi(x)-\Phi(d)\right)}}{k\ix{B}T\ix{e}}\right)}\quad .%
					\label{equ:electrondens}
				\end{align}

				This means that the electron density decreases exponentially towards the negatively charged wall. It can be assumed that the sheath thickness $d\ll s\ix{mfp,i}$ the mean free path of the ions inside the plasma bulk. Hence, ions enter the sheath collisionless.\\
				At the boundary between bulk and pre-sheath, the walls potential vanishes because of the plasmas shielding capabilities. Here, the ions are at $v\ix{i,0}$ speeds, therefore their density becomes:

				\begin{align}
					n\ix{i}(x)=n\ix{i}(d){\left(1-\frac{2e\Phi(x)}{m\ix{i}v\ix{i,0}^{2}}\right)}^{-1/2}%
					\label{equ:iondens}
				\end{align}

				Futhermore, one can assume that the kinetic energy at this point is smaller than the potential energy for the acceleration inside the pre-sheath, e.g.\@ $m\ix{i}v\ix{i,0}^{2}\ll |e\Phi(x)|$. Using \emph{Poisson's } equation, and taking into account the ion-sheath interaction,~\autoref{equ:phibypoisson} gives an equation for $\Phi(x)$:

				\begin{align}
					\Delta\Phi\cong-\frac{en\ix{i}\left(-d\right)}{\varepsilon\ix{0}}\left(-\frac{2e\Phi\left(x\right)}{m\ix{I}v\ix{i,0}^2}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}%
					\label{equ:phibypoisson}
				\end{align}

				Solving this, and using the unpertubated ion current $j\ix{i}=n\ix{i}(d)ev\ix{i,0}$, one yields the result by \emph{Langmuir}.

				\begin{align}
					\Phi\left(x\right)=\left(\left(\frac{3}{4}\left(x+d\right)\right)^4\left(\frac{j\ix{i}}{\varepsilon\ix{0}}\right)^2\frac{m\ix{i}}{2e}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}%
					\label{equ:langmuirpot}
				\end{align}

				Again, solving~\autoref{equ:langmuirpot} for the current $j\ix{i}$ yields the \emph{Child-Langmuir Law} (see~\autoref{equ:childlangmuirlaw}).\\
				This equation defines the ion current as a function of the unpertubated plasma bulk. In other words, the sheath changes its thickness in dependency of those certain discharge parameters, always satisfying the ion current defined by the \emph{Child-Langmuir Law}.

				\begin{align}
					j\ix{i}=\frac{4}{9}\varepsilon\ix{0}\left(\frac{2e\left(\Phi\left(-d\right)-\Phi\left(0\right)\right)^3}{m\ix{i}d^2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}%
					\label{equ:childlangmuirlaw}
				\end{align}

		\subsection{Bohm Criteria}\label{subsec:bohmcriteria}

			In~\autoref{subsec:sheathphysics} the behaviour of charge particle densities inside the plasma sheath has been discussed. In contrast to the discharge volume, those densities do not satisfy the quasi-neutrality condition in a distance of $d$ from the wall anymore. Though we know that the sheath is a spacially restricted area around electrostatic floating surfaces, a physical law concerning this circumstance has not been derived here. So the question ensues, why the area of electron depletion does not extend further into the discharge volume.\\
		To answer this question, one has to take a look at a substitutional system. This will be a, likewise mechanical, one-body extremal problem of a point mass. In this case only kinematic pontentials with inverted parabolic maxima are of interest. Therefore, in this unstable equilibrium, a small pertubation culminates into a large force on the test body.\\
		To see the quality of this example, one has to take a look at the second order differential equation of the afore-mentioned mechanical problem and the electrostatic \emph{Poisson's equation} (see~\autoref{equ:pseudo}).

  	\begin{align} 
  	  m\frac{\diff^{2}\vec{r}}{\diff t^{2}}=-\frac{\diff V}{\diff\vec{r}}%
			\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad%
			\Delta_{\vec{r}}\Phi=-\frac{\diff\Psi}{\diff\Phi}=f{\left(\Phi\right)}%
			\hspace{-0.33cm}\overset{\text{Poisson's}}{\overset{\mid}{=}}\hspace{-0.33cm}%
			\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon\ix{0}}\label{equ:pseudo}
  	\end{align}

		For an instability, the force on the test body must increase with the distance from the equilibrium, hence the~\autoref{equ:inequality} is used to calculate the exact velocity at which an ion is entering the sheath. This results in the first \emph{Bohm criteria}.

		\begin{align}
			0>\left.\frac{\diff^{2}\Psi}{\diff\Phi^{2}}\right|_{\Phi=0}%
			\overset{\text{\autoref{equ:pseudo}}}{\overset{\mid}{=}}%
			\left.\frac{\diff}{\diff\Phi}\left(\frac{n\ix{e}\left(x\right)-n\ix{i}\left(x\right)}{\varepsilon\ix{0}}\right)\right|_{\Phi=0}&%
			\frac{en\ix{e}\left(-d\right)}{\varepsilon\ix{0}}\left(\frac{e}{k\ix{b}T\ix{e}}-\frac{e}{m\ix{i}v\ix{i,0}^{2}}\right)%
			\label{equ:beding}\\%
			\Rightarrow\quad%
			v\ix{i,0}\ge v\ix{i,B}=\sqrt{\frac{k\ix{B}T\ix{e}}{m\ix{i}}}&%
			\label{equ:inequality}
		\end{align}
	
		Analoguos you can define the so called \emph{Mach number} $M=v\ix{i,0}/v\ix{i,B}$, where $v\ix{i,B}$ denotes the \emph{Bohm velocity}.\\
		Now, to understand why the sheath does not extend further than a fixed distance $d$ from the discharge boundary, the particle movement has to be investigated on a smaller scale. As seen above, there is an electric field in the \emph{pre-sheath} that accelerates the ions to $v\ix{i,B}$. In addition, quasi-neutrality is still satisfied here:

		\begin{align}
			n\ix{I}\left(x\right)=n\ix{I,0}\exp\left(\frac{e\Phi\left(x\right)}{k\ix{B}T\ix{e}}\right)%
			=n\ix{e}\left(x\right)\,\,.\label{equ:quasineutral}
		\end{align}

		Still, $\Phi{\left(x\right)}$ is the potential inside the pre-sheath from~\autoref{subsec:sheathphysics} and $n\ix{i,0}$ the unpertubated density from the plasma \emph{bulk}. A greater part of the ion transport process in this area is governed by collisions with neutral gas particles, hence the velocity distribution function with the collision frequency $\nu{n,i}$ has to be rewritten:

		\begin{align}
			\frac{\diff v\ix{i}}{\diff x}=\frac{\nu{n,i}v\ix{i}^{2}}{v\ix{B}^{2}-v\ix{i}^{2}}\quad .\label{equ:distribution}
		\end{align}

		From the singularity in~\autoref{equ:distribution} at $v\ix{i}=v\ix{B}$ and the knowledge of $\Phi(x)$ at the wall, one can calculate the sheath thickness $d$. Furthermore, ions with velocities smaller than the Bohm velocity are being accelerated inside the pre sheath. According to~\autoref{equ:inequality} velocities greater than $v\ix{B}$ are not allowed here. This is, together with~\autoref{equ:distribution} the reason why the ion velocity is exactly $v\ix{B}$ at the boundary of the plasma sheath and thus a positive space charge ensues.

		\begin{align}
			M=1%
			\Leftrightarrow%
			v\ix{i}(-d)=v\ix{B}\label{equ:bohmcriteria2}
		\end{align}

		Conclusively, at the sheath boundary~\autoref{equ:bohmcriteria2} is satisfied.\\
  At $x=-d$, both negative and positive charge density decreased to $n\ix{i}=n\ix{e}\approx0,66n\ix{e,0}$ (see~\autoref{fig:densities}), where the potential is approximately $-k\ix{B}T\ix{e}/2e$ because of the currents onto the wall.\\
		In summerization, the plasma does not "see" its sheath, because the ion dynamic discussed before is spatially restricted. The sheath only develops where there is electron depletion or an externally applied, negative potential.

		\subsection{Self Bias Voltage}\label{subsec:selfbias}

			An important step towards the electric characterization of such ccrf discharges is the development of a replacement circuit, see~\autoref{img:replacementcirquit}. Thus, one can define a specific impedance for a rf discharge of excitation frequency $\omega$. The valeu of $\varepsilon\ix{p}$ resembles the permeability of the working gas between the driven and/or grounded electrode. In addition, this volume has the capacity $C\ix{p}$ --- the capacity of a cubicle with a cross section $A$, thickness $b$ and electron-neutral collision frequency $\nu\ix{e,n}$ calculates like~\autoref{equ:capacityandepsilon}.

			\begin{align}
				\varepsilon\ix{p}=1-&\frac{\omega\ix{p,e}^2}{\omega\left(\omega-\imag\nu\ix{e,n}\right)}\quad\quad%
				C\ix{p}=\varepsilon\ix{p}C\ix{0}=%
				\varepsilon\ix{p}\varepsilon\ix{0}\frac{A}{b}%
				\label{equ:capacityandepsilon}\\
				&Z\ix{p}=\left(\imag\omega C\ix{p}+ \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\omega\ix{p,e}^2C\ix{0}}\left(\nu\ix{e,n}+\imag\omega\right)}\right)^{-1}
				\label{equ:bulkimpedanz}
			\end{align}
		
      The~\autoref{equ:bulkimpedanz} represents the full electrical impedance, consisting of the inverse sum of real and imagninary resitance, as well as the capacity of the neutral gas volume. Here, $\imag\omega/(\omega\ix{p,e}^{2}C\ix{0})$ characterizes the electrons interia in regard to an external excitation $\omega$. The real part $\nu\ix{e,n}/(\omega\ix{p,e}^{2}C\ix{0})$ denotes the resistance by neutral particle collisions.\\
        For high excitation frequencies, e.g.\@ $\unit[13,56]{MHz}$ the bulk impedance can be neglected. Both sheath capacities of anode and cathode take the dominant part. Therefore, the discharge potential and voltage can be written as:

			\begin{align}
				U\left(t\right)=U\ix{sb}+U\ix{rf}\sin\left(\omega t\right)%
        \quad\quad%
        \Phi\ix{p}\left(t\right)=\overline{\Phi\ix{p}}+%
          \Phi\ix{rf}\sin\left(\omega t\right)%
        \label{equ:selfbias_1}
			\end{align}

      Both electrodes sheath collapses completely during a full cycle of $U\ix{rf}(t)$, which is why charges can impinge onto the surface and force the plasma potential $\Phi\ix{P}$ to equal out locally with the walls. A short circuit between plasma and sheath occurs when $\Phi\ix{P}$ becomes negative with regard to the excitation. The~\autoref{equ:selfbias_unequal} and~\autoref{fig:selfbias} express this circumstance.

      \begin{align}
        \Phi\ix{p,max}=\overline{\Phi\ix{p}}+\Phi\ix{rf}\geq U\ix{sb}+U\ix{rf}%
        \quad\quad %
        \Phi\ix{p,min}=\overline{\Phi\ix{p}}-\Phi\ix{rf}\geq0\,\, .%
        \label{equ:selfbias_unequal}
      \end{align}
     
      If there is no special coupling between electrode and electrical driver, the equality in~\autoref{equ:selfbias_unequal} is true. However, if a capacitive coupling is used, there can't be any net current between excitation and electrode. The capacitance can not be inverted over the course of one rf cycle. The electron currents are then equal on both electrodes, therefore shifting the minimum plasma potential to ground and the maximum to the excitation.\\
      Finally, the dc \emph{self bias} part $U\ix{sb}$ and the mean plasma potential $\overline{U\ix{p}}$ are

      \begin{align}
        \overline{\Phi\ix{p}}=\frac{1}{2}\left(U\ix{sb}+U\ix{rf}\right)%
        \quad\quad%
        U\ix{sb}=\frac{C\ix{1}-C\ix{2}}{C\ix{1}+C\ix{2}}U\ix{rf}\,\, .%
        \label{eq:selfbiaszwei} 
      \end{align}
      
      If the excitation frequency $\omega$ is small compared to other time scales, e.g\@ electron and ion plasma frequencies, the electron current from the sheath $j\ix{L}$ becomes bigger than the displacement current $j\ix{dc}$ so wird der Strom aus den verdr\"angten Elektronen $j\ix{L}$ gr\"o{\ss}er als der Verschiebungsstrom durch die Randschichtschwankung $j\ix{V}\,$. Demzufolge wird der Strom aus Elektronen auf die getriebenen Elektrode, im Vergleich zu dem aus Ionen, durch einen Maxwell-Faktor in Abhängigkeit der angelegten Spannung verkleinert. Die Impedanz der Randschicht über der Elektrode ist deswegen wesentlich größer als die der anderen bzw. der Wände. Mit den \autoref{eq:selfbiaseins} und \autoref{eq:ungleichungen} folgt, dass das Plasma-Potential näherungsweise verschwindet und deswegen nur die Kontinuität für den Strom auf die getriebene Elektrode erhalten sein muss. Der \tilt{self-bias} bei kleinen Anregungsfrequenzen ergibt sich in \autoref{eq:selfbiasdrei} ($\mathbf{J}\ix{0}$ \tilt{Bessel-Funktion}, nach \cite{Piel10}). 
      %
      %						\begin{align}
      %							U\ix{GS}=\frac{k\ix{B}T\ix{e}}{e}\ln\left[\mathbf{J}\ix{0}\left(\frac{eU\ix{rf}}{k\ix{B}T\ix{e}}\right)\right] \label{eq:selfbiasdrei}
      %						\end{align}
      %
      %					In \autoref{img:imagundreal} ist der Spannungsverlauf beispielhaft dargestellt. Der \tilt{self-bias} verschwindet demnach nie für Elektrodenspannungen  $U\ix{rf}\neq0$ und ist damit eine feste Größe in Radiofrequenz-Entladungen, welche über kapazitive Bauteile betrieben werden.

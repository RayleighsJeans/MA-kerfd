	\section{Experimental setup}\label{sec:twod_setup}
%
		Giving the necessary background in~\autoref{sec:surfaceeffects} and providing the crucially important comparison of the previous~\autoref{sec:chapter_onedcomparison}, the afore-mentioned effects of highly energetic negative oxygen ions can now be further investigated.
%
		\subsection{Reference Discharge}\label{sec:reference_dis}
%
	Here, the referenced experiment was first established and used by Kuellig, Meichsner et al.~\cite{Kullig12} and consists of a cylindrical setup, filled with oxygen at low pressures and gas flow rates. The stainless steel vacuum chamber had a diameter and height of $\unit[40]{cm}$ respectively and was filled with the process gas oxygen (O$\ix{2}$) at $\unit[5]{sccm}$. The discharge configuration consisted of an electrode with $\unit[10]{cm}$ of diameter and a rf generator, constantly operating at a frequency of $\unit[13,56]{MHz}$ and power outputs between $5$ and $\unit[150]{W}$, leading to applied voltages in the range of $100$--$\unit[1500]{V}$. Shielding and discharge enclosure/chamber walls were grounded, therefore yielding a large area ratio between driven and grounded electrode and establishing a heavily asymmetric plasma. In addition, the powered electrode was coupled capacitively with the external generator, emphasizing the effect of the, in~\autoref{sec:selfbias} introduced self bias voltage. The value of $U\ix{sb}$ ranged, depending on power output and discharge pressure, from $-100$ up to $\unit[500]{V}$. In~\cite{Kullig12} the experiment was pulsed with short discharges at a frequency of $\unit[10]{Hz}$.	Line integrated measurements resulted in an average electron density of around $\tenpo{11}$--$\unit[\tenpo{12}]{cm^{-3}}$. Showing a schematic top-down view of the expirment is~\autoref{fig:expchamber}. Here, the large ratio between driven and grounded parts is very well visualized. Hence, in later simulations it will be of sufficient accuracy to restrain the virtualized volume to a smaller setup.\\

			The figure below includes further diagnostics like a mass spectrometer (\fett{MS}) and phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy (\fett{PROES}). The latter measured the mentioned densities via line integration across the plasma volume. The MS is a key instrument for the investigation pursued in this thesis, as it also measures species counts with respect to their contribution to their correspoding energy distribution function. For example, the ions created via secondary processes in the discharge sheath are accelerated towards the bulk and thus get into the MS with their characteristic speeds and mass. A significant increase of electron density was found for rf powers larger than $\unit[50]{W}$ or $\unit[-220]{V}$ self bias voltage~\cite{Kullig12}. This led to a correlating negativ oxygen ion density reduction and decrease of the electronegativity ratio $\overline{n}_{i,-}/\overline{n}\ix{e}$ from $4$ to $0,03$. During a different operation mode --- called $\alpha$-mode, contrary to the afore-mentioned $\gamma$-mode --- at less than $\unit[50]{V}$ output power, electronegativity rises again, as well as the electron temperature $T\ix{e}$, yielding higher rate coefficients for, e.g.\@ dissociative electron attachment and the alike. See~\autoref{sec:anionproduction} for a more detailed approach.

		\subsection{Simulated Discharge}\label{sec:simulatedd_dis}
%
			All of the above conditions are sufficient for a practical approach at a labratory ccrf discharge with great repeatability. Though being highly optimized and developed over the course of many years, the twodimensional particle-in-cell code outlined above does not provide the tools and performance to feasibly simulate such large areas and particle numbers. Hence, one will reside to reducing the numerical expense by virtualizing smaller discharge areas and average densities, while trying to satisfy the same physical processes exhibited by in~\cite{Kullig12}.\\
			The afore-mentioned 2d3v PIC code is used to simulated the referenced experiment. The spatial dimensions will be the radial component $r$ and axial coordinate $z$. The geometry and simulation is optimized for cylindrically symmetric gas discharges.\\
			To represent the strong asymmetry between driven and grounded wall areas, the sizes of anode, cathode and grounded chamber parts have been chosing accordingly. The experimental values for the self bias voltage $U\ix{sb}$ were used to create a dc offset on-top of the rf voltage $U\ix{rf}$ at the cathode. The domain composition with cells of width $\lambda\ix{D,e}/2$ (see~\autoref{sec:picbasics}) makes it even more difficult to appropriately model the system. Hence a smaller discharge volume of a $\unit[4,5]{cm}$ radius and an electrode gap of $\unit[2,5]{cm}$ will be simulated. This usually leads to cell counts up to $2\cdot\tenpo{5}$, which is small in comparison to the ``real'' experiment, which would have to be covered by over $\tenpo{6}$ cells. Furthermore, the numerical expense grows with $N\log(N)$, and $N$ being the particle number inside the cells (see~\autoref{sec:picsimulationmcc}).\\
			One has chosen pressures between $\unit[2]{Pa}$ and $\unit[10]{Pa}$, with the possibility of changing it later during the discharges simulation --- e.g\@ to change the bulk volume and densities. The secondary ion emission efficiency was set to $\eta=0,03$ in all cases, yielding a stable plasma sheath and hence SIE current into the bulk. In addition, a constant self bias of $\unit[-200]{V}$ was appplied at the cathode. The radio frequency was set to $\unit[13,56]{MHz}$.\\
			The governing electron density and temperature were set to $\unit[5\cdot\tenpo{9}]{cm^{-3}}$ and $\unit[5]{eV}$ respectively, which, as an initial value and property for scale, is sufficient for the necessary rate coefficients mentioned above. This led to the following important scales of simulation: 
%
			\begin{align}
				\lambda\ix{D}&=\unit[0.0235]{cm}\,,%
				\hspace*{2.0cm}%
				\omega\ix{p,e}=\unit[3,99\cdot\tenpo{9}]{Hz}%
				\label{equ:debyeandomega}\\[0.0cm]
				\Rightarrow \Delta x&=\frac{1}{2}\,\lambda\ix{D}=\unit[0.01174]{cm}\,,%
				\quad\quad%
				\Delta t=0,2\cdot\omega\ix{p,e}=\unit[5,015\cdot\tenpo{-11}]{s}%
				\label{equ:simulationscales}
			\end{align}
%			
			Thus a single rf cycle at the given frequency takes $1470$ steps, and the domain measures $384$ and $213$ in $r$ and $z$ dimension respectively. The corresponding velocities for the previously defined electron temperature $T\ix{e}=\unit[5]{eV}=\unit[58025]{K}$ are found to be
%
			\begin{align}
				v\ix{th,e}=\unit[8383]{\frac{m}{s}}\,,%
				\quad\quad%
				c\ix{s,e}=\unit[]{}%
			\end{align}

			In~\cite{Kullig12} stable and equilibriated discharges were created serveral times per second due to the pulsed duty cycle of the generator. Here, a single millisecond of operation takes days, if not weeks to simulate.
